# Nextflow workshop

This repository holds some of the scripts used in the workshop for "Using Nextflow for Genomics Analysis"

The exercises for this workshop will be conducted on Ubuntu 20.04 systems with Python 3.8 or Python 3.9 installed. If you are using a Windows 10 or 11 laptop you can also set up a Ubuntu 20.04 distro in WSL2 to follow along.
